The umIToolbox, or umIT for short is a toolbox written in MATLAB created to help researchers process, visualize and analyse mesoscale imaging datasets. This is an open-source project and is maintained by [LabeoTech](http://www.labeotech.com).
The toolbox is currently in active development and new features are added periodically. 

This toolbox is dedicated to our beloved friend ***Umit Keysan*** (1992-2019).
