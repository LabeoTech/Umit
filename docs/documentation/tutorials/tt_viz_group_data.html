    <h2>Visualize grouped data</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Until now, you learned how to use <b><i>umIT</i></b> to import, preprocess, extract and aggregate data from imaging datasets. Now, the data from individual recordings need to be put together in their respective experimental groups and visualized. This is an important step to perform the exploratory and inferential data analysis necessary to answer your scientific questions.

    <p>
      Here, we will use the correlation matrices generated in our previous tutorial on <a href="./tt_extracting_data_from_rois.html">how to extract ROI data</a> as an example to illustrate the data grouping and visualization. The toolbox provides a tool dedicated to the visualization of correlation matrices called <i>Plot Correlation Matrix</i>. This and other tools are available in the <i>Apps & tools</i> panel in the <i>Analysis</i> tab of the main GUI (<samp>umIToolbox</samp>). To learn about the other tools, please read the documentation of the <a href="#">umIToolbox</a> app.
