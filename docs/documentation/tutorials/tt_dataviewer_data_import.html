    <h2>Data Import</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The <b><i>DataViewer</i></b> app uses data stored in <samp>.dat</samp> files. These files are generated using one of the data import options provided in the app. The two types of raw data that can be imported are the <samp>.bin</samp> files created by <a href="http://www.labeotech.com">LabeoTech</a>'s Modular Optical Imaging Systems (e.g. LightTrack OiS200) or a <samp>.TIFF</samp> file containing the data from a single channel. 
    </p>
    <h3>Import raw binary data from LightTrack OiS200</h3>
    <p>
        The data generated by the LightTrack OiS200 system consists of one or more files with names like <samp>img_0000x.bin</samp>. These files contain the images from one or more illumination channels. The importing process will separate the individual channels into a sequence of images (i.e. image time series) for each channel and save the channel's data to a <samp>.dat</samp> file that can be opened by <b><i>DataViewer</i></b>.
        <br>
        To import the raw data follow the steps below:        
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to <b>File &rarr; Import Raw Data &rarr; from LabeoTech System</b></li>
        <li>Select the recording folder containing the <samp>img_0000x.bin</samp> files</li>
        <li>Select the folder where the channel data (<samp>.dat</samp> files) will be saved</li>
        <li>
            Now, set the data import parameters and click <b>Ok</b>. Here, you can apply <b>spatial</b> and/or <b>temporal</b> binning to the raw data. Additionally, set the <b>DetectEvents</b> to <b>Yes</b> if there are triggers to be detected (the events detection is covered in <a href="">this tutorial</a>)

                    For more information on the data import parameters check the <a href="../userDocs/fcns/run_ImagesClassification.html">run_ImagesClassification</a> documentation.
                </p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Once the data import process is finished, select one of the <samp>.dat</samp> files to open</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Import data from a TIFF file</h3>
    <p>
        The <b><i>DataViewer</i></b> app provides an option to import data from other sources. The data should be stored in <samp>.TIFF</samp> format and each file should have the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>be an image time series with dimensions Y,X,T(ime) from a single channel</li>        
        <li>pixel values should be unsigned integers  with <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> or <b>32</b> bits</li>        
        <li>have a .txt file with the same name as the .TIF file located in the folder which contains meta data about the recording</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The text file <samp>.txt</samp> with the same name of the <samp>.TIFF</samp> file should be stored in the same folder as the <samp>.TIFF</samp> file(s) with basic information about the data. Here is a template of the text file with the minimal information needed for the data import to work:
    </p>
    <div class="black-box">
<pre style="white-space: pre;">
<code>
Scan info
DateTime: yyyymmdd_HHMMSS
FrameRateHz: 30.00
ExposureMsec: 0.10
Illumination1: DAT_CHANNEL_NAME
</code>
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Replace the <b>DateTime</b> field by the recording timestamp in the format indicated above and type the <samp>.dat</samp> file name that will store the the channel data after the import processing. Replace the "DAT_CHANNEL_NAME" in the <b>Illumination1</b> field by the name of the <samp>.dat</samp> file that will store the data from the <samp>.TIFF</samp> file.        
    </p>
    <div class="warnnote">
        <p><strong>Important</strong>
            If there are more than one <samp>.TIFF</samp> file, create a text file for each channel with an unique name in the <b>Illumination1</b> field. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        To import raw data stored as <samp>.TIFF</samp> files:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Go to <b>File &rarr; Import Raw Data &rarr; from TIFF</b></li>
        <li>Select the folder containing the <samp>.TIFF</samp> file(s)</li>
        <li>Select the folder to save the <samp>.dat</samp> files</li>
        <li>
            Set the import options. Here one can apply a <b>spatial</b> and/or <b>temporal</b> binning

                    For more information on the data import parameters and details on the associated text file check the <a href="../userDocs/fcns/importFromTif.html">importFromTif</a> documentation.

            </div>
        </li>
        <li>The data import function will import all <samp>.TIFF</samp> files (with the respective <samp>.txt</samp> files) located in the folder. Once the data import process is finished, select one of the <samp>.dat</samp> files to open</li>
