    <p>
        The <strong><em>umIToolbox</em></strong> application is specifically tailored for efficiently managing high-throughput mesoscopic imaging experiments. It establishes a well-organized workspace that empowers users to effortlessly oversee and streamline a substantial volume of datasets while automating data processing tasks spanning multiple directories. In addition, it provides a set of tools to visualize grouped data and perform statistical analysis.
    </p>
    <h3>How the app operates</h3>
    <p>
        A typical imaging <strong>project</strong> consists of one or more cohorts of <strong>subjects</strong> (e.g.
        mice) that undergo one or more <strong>acquisition</strong> (i.e. recording) sessions. Frequently, other
        recording <strong>modalities</strong> are associated with the imaging data such as behavioral responses,
        eye/body tracking, etc. The toolbox follows the same organization principle where one can manage subjects,
        acquisitions and recording modalities for a given project.

        <em>Conceptual organization of a typical imaging project.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong><em>umIToolbox</em></strong> application leverages the same conceptual framework to systematically structure experimental data and metadata while automating data processing. It seamlessly integrates data visualization and analysis within a unified interface where the user can control all the aspects of a typical mesoscale imaging project.
