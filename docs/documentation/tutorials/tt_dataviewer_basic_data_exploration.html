    <h2>Basic data exploration</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, we will explore an intermediate step from the preproceesing of a resting state experiment. The
        data consists of the fluorescence signal that was corrected for
        the hemodynamic artifacts, followed by the removal of the global signal variance and temporally filtered and
        normalized.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is a screenshot of the app with the data loaded. It consists of three windows: the main window (1), where
        all the options and controls are located, the image window (2) where the current frame of the data is shown, and
        the temporal signal window (3) where the temporal profile of the selected pixel is displayed.
    </p>

        Click on a pixel to get it's temporal profile:

    <p>
        To change frames, either <b>move the slider</b> in the main window or <b>double-click</b> on the plot from the
        temporal signal window:
    </p>

        controls></video>
    <p>
        Also, use the figure's <i>datatip</i> tool <img src="../assets/img/tt_dataviewer_datatip_icon.png"
            alt="tt_dataviewer_datatip_icon"> to add fixed data tips over the image or the temporal profile to show the
        pixel values as so:
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/tt_dataviewer_datatips_example.png" alt="tt_dataviewer_datatips_example" width="880">
    <div class="warnnote">
        <p><strong>Important</strong><br>
            Don't forget to <b>deactivate</b> the datatip button before interacting with the figure. Some of the
            figure's interactions are suspended when the datatip mode is active.
        </p>
    </div>

        Now, let's adjust the color scale limits to better visualize the fluctuations of the fluorescence signal across
        the mouse cortex. To do so you can simply use the vertical zoom option on the temporal signal window as so:
    </p>

        controls></video>
    <p>
        If you want to give a precise number, go to <i>Settings &gt;&gt; Image Options</i> and change the values of
        <b>min</b> and <b>max</b>. In addition, we can also change the default colormap through the <i>Image
            Options</i>:
    </p>

        alt="tt_dataviewer_set_clims_and_colormap_in_imagOpts" width="880" controls></video>
    <p>
        Finally, we can use the playback button to display the "movie" of the fluorescence signal. This recording was
        obtained with a frame rate of 5Hz (default playback speed). We can change the playback speed in <i>Settings
            &gt;&gt; Playback speed</i>. Below, we can observe the fluctuations of the fluorescence signal across the
        mouse cortical areas (playback speed at 3 times the real frame rate):
