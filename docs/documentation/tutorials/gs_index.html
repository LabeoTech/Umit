    <h5><font color = "gray">Toolbox to manage, process and visualize widefield imaging experiments.</font></h5>
    <p><b><i>UmIT</i></b> is dedicated to the processing, visualization and analysis of mesoscale imaging datasets. It provides tools to assist on experiment and data management, automation of data processing pipelines as well as imaging data visualization.</p>
    <p>
      The toolbox works through two main apps: <b><i>DataViewer</i></b> and <b><i>umIToolbox</i></b>. <b><i>DataViewer</i></b> is dedicated to the visualization and processing of single recordings as well as batch processing a number of recordings. This app is then suitable for low to medium throughput imaging experiments. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b><i>umIToolbox</i></b> app, on the other hand, is dedicated to the management of large-scale experiments. It provides a structured environment where the user can manage the experiment data and meta data in a single graphical interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this <b>Getting started</b> section, you will be able to explore the basics of the two apps and their respective auxiliary apps and tools to assist you with the processing, visualization and analysis of mesoscale imaging recordings.
