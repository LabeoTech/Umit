    <h2>Extract data from ROIs</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Once ROIs are created, one can then extract and aggregate the data from individual ROIs across multiple recordings. First, the data extraction from ROIs allows the exclusion of non-pertinent information. Secondly, the (spatial) aggregation of ROI data adds an extra layer of data reduction. Both operations represent a crucial step in an imaging project where meaningful values are created that will ultimately be used for group comparisons and statistics.

    <p align="center"><i>Main steps of a typical imaging project to underscore the role of ROI extraction and aggregation. a) Processing steps for a single experiment where the extraction and aggregation of ROI data yields ROI values. b) The ROI values of each recording session is grouped for comparisons.</i></p>
    <p>
      Before extracting the data from the ROIs, we assume that the following procedures were previously executed:
      <ul>
        <li>The data from single recordings were properly preprocessed.</li>
        <li>The preprocessed data is aligned to a <i>reference frame</i>.</li>
        <li>ROIs were created and saved to a <samp>ROImasks_&lt;NAME&gt;.mat</samp> file. </li>
      </ul>
