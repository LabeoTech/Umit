        The <b><i>DataViewer</i></b> app is designed for efficient processing and visualization of imaging datasets. Its primary objective is to facilitate basic exploration of individual recording whereby the users can quiclky process (e.g. filtering, normalization etc.) and visualize the data. Additionally, the application allows for batch processing, making it suitable for handling multiple recordings with the same ease as single recordings. <br>
        As a result, <b><i>DataViewer</i></b> is ideal for the analysis of a single recording during an experiment, as well as for post-experiment data analysis in low to medium throughput experiments.
