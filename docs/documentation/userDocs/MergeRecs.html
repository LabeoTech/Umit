    <h2>Merge recording tool</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This tool is a part of the <a href="./umIToolbox.html"><samp>umIToolbox</samp></a> app. It allows the concatenation of two or more recordings in the time domain or as trials.
    </p>
    <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This tool accepts only imaging data that have the same frame size (i.e. same Y,X dimension sizes). For the concatenationa as trials, the size of the time dimension of the first recording will be the size of each trial. It is assumed that all recordings have the same number of frames or the difference is negligible.
    </p>
    <h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4 id="1-launch-the-tool">1. Launch the tool</h4>
    <p>
      First of all, open the <samp>umIToolbox</samp> app and load a project file. Once the file is loaded, go to <i>Utilities &gt;&gt; Merge Recordings</i> to launch the tool. The list of objects from the <samp>umIToolbox</samp> app will appear in the tool. Thus, you can optionally filter the object tree before opening the tool.
    </p>
    <h4 id="2-Select the objects">2. Select the objects</h4>
    <p>
      Select the objects containing the recordings in the object tree (left). Here, you can select several acquisitions from one or more subjects. The recordings will be merged across different acquisitions from one subject at a time.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h4 id="3-select-the-acquisitions">3. Select the acquisitions</h4>
    <p>
      Once the objects are selected, the acquisitions are listed in the "Choose acquisitions" list box. If two or more subjects are selected, only the acquisitions that exist in all subjects will appear in this list. Highlight the acquisitions containing the data to be merged.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">

    </p>
    <h4 id="4-select-the-modality">4. Select the modality</h4>
    <p>
      Now, select the modality containing the recording to be merged. Here, only one modality will be allowed to be selected.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">

    </p>
    <h4 id="5-select-the-file">5. Select the file</h4>
    <p>
      Here, all files that exist in the selected modality folder of all selected acquisitions will be displayed. Select the file to be merged and click on the "Select" button.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">

    </p>
    <h4 id="6-reorder-data">6. Reorder the data</h4>
    <p>
      Once the "Select" button is pushed, a panel will appear with the options to merge the data. In the "Set order" list box, click on the individual acquisition names and use the arrows to reorder the list. <i>The data will be merged in the top-down order of the list.</i>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="../assets/img/MergeRec_fig5.png" alt="MergeRec_fig5" width="660">
    </p>    
    <h4 id="7-events">7. Events</h4>
    <p>
      In the <i>events</i> panel, one can either overwrite the events IDs from the source recordings or ignore the content of the <samp>events.mat</samp> files. New event IDs should be separated by ";".
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that indepedently of the options selected, an <samp>events.mat</samp> file will be created in the merged recording folder. Here is how the events are managed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Source files already have <samp>events.mat</samp> files:</b> Here, the new <samp>events.mat</samp> file will contain the concatenation of the events from the source files.</li>
      <li><b>Source files do not have <samp>events.mat</samp> files:</b> Here, the new <samp>events.mat</samp> file will simply mark the first and last frames from the source recordings in the merged one.</li>
    </ul>        
    <p style="text-align: center">

    </p>
    
    <h4 id="9-id-new-data">9. Identify the new acquisition and file</h4>
    <p>
      Type the name of the acquisition that will contain the merged file. If the acquisition already exists, the merged file will be stored in the modality folder inside it. Then, type the name of the merged file.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="../assets/img/MergeRec_fig6b.png" alt="MergeRec_fig6b" width="660">
    </p>
    <h4 id="10-merge-data">10. Merge the file</h4>
    <p>
      Finally, click on the <i>Merge Data</i> button to merge the data. This tool uses the <samp>mergeRecordings.m</samp> function to execute the merging.
    </p>
    <p>Once finished, either close the tool or go back to merge another file. Once the tool is closed the project file is automatically saved and the object tree is updated.</p>
