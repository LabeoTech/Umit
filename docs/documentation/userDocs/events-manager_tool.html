    <h2>Event management tool</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This tool is an <i>Utility</i> of the <a href="./DataViewer.html"><samp>DataViewer</samp></a> app. The app is
        dedicated to the visualization and detection of events stored in the analog inputs from <i>LabeoTech Imaging
            systems</i>. It enables users to easily set the parameters for event detection either from internally
        generated events from the imaging platforms or from external sources such as TTL signals or photodiodes.
        Additionally, a list of event IDs stored in a .CSV or text file can be used to identify the detected events
        associated with different conditions. Finally, one can save the event information to an <samp>events.mat</samp>
        file, which can be used by some of the <i>functions</i> in <b><i>umIT</i></b> (e.g. <a
            href="./split_data_by_event.html">split_data_by_event</a>) to perform the analysis of event-triggered
        imaging data.

        <li><b>Event detection parameters</b>:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Threshold:</b> threshold (in volts) for detection of events. If set to "auto", the threshold is
                    calculated as <span class="code-inline">0.8*max(signal)</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>min. interstim (s):</b> minimum inter-stimulation time period (in seconds). This parameter is
                    used to put together a block of signal bursts as a single event. As shown in the figure above, each
                    event consists of a series of three bursts with 0.7 seconds delay and an inter-stimulus (time delay
                    between events) of 1 second. By setting a value between 0.7 and 1, we can successfully distinguish
                    the individual blocks of bursts.

                    There are two types: <i><b>EdgeSet</b></i> (default) and <b><i>EdgeToggle</i></b>.
                    The
                    <i>EdgeSet</i> type consists of a rising and falling edges of a pulse marking the beginning and end
                    of an event while the <i>EdgeToggle</i> represents a pulse at the start and another pulse at the end
                    of the event (see illustration below).

    </ol>

    <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        To launch the tool, open the <samp>DataViewer</samp> app and go to <i>Utilities &gt;&gt; Manage events</i>. To
        access the <i>Utilities</i> menu, either open a <samp>.dat</samp> file (<i>File &gt;&gt; Open</i>) or import the
        raw data (<i>File &gt;&gt; Import raw data... &gt;&gt; from LabeoTech system</i>)
    </p>
    <div class="tipnote">
        <p><strong>Tip</strong><br>
            If you import the raw data, you can skip the event detection by setting the <b>DetectEvents</b> parameter to
            <b>No</b> to save time. The app will read the analog data and create the <samp>events.mat</samp> file later
            in the app.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>1. Select the data folder</h4>
    <p>
        The app will automatically open the the binary files (<samp>ai_0000x.bin</samp>) containing the analog signals.
        If the files are not found, you will be asked to select the folder containing the files. Once the files are
        read, the app interface will appear. The save folder where the <samp>events.mat</samp> file will be saved is the
        same from the opened <samp>.dat</samp> file.
    </p>
    <h4 id="2_select-channel_s">2. Select channel(s)</h4>
    <p>
        Select one or more channels from the list in the <i>Select channel(s)</i>. The list of channels is based on the
        content of the <samp>info.txt</samp> file.
    </p>
    <div class="infonote">
        <p><strong>Note</strong><br>
            If two or more channels are selected, for each channel, the events detected will be automatically considered
            as a condition, if no condition list is provided. For example, if there are events in the channels
            <b>StimAna1</b> and <b>StimAna2</b>, the events will have a total number of two conditions with names
            <b>StimAna1</b> and <b>StimAna2</b>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="3_choose-a-condition-file">3. Choose a condition file</h4>
    <p>
        This app provides a convenient feature for cases where the events detected are associated with multiple
        conditions. Users have the option to upload a .CSV file (or a text file from Vpixx-special case) that will be
        used to update the list of event names. This can be particularly useful when dealing with cases where there are
        different stimuli (i.e. conditions) presented in a random order.
    </p>
    <h4 id="csv-files">CSV files</h4>
    <p>
        Users can prepare a .CSV file that includes the event names listed in chronological order with each event name
        in a separate row. Upon uploading the file through the app's interface, the app will process the contents and
        update the event name list accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        To upload a .CSV file:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Change the condition <b>type</b> to <b>CSV</b></li>
        <li>Click on <b><i>Choose file...</i></b> button</li>
        <li>Select the .CSV file in the folder</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The app will read the content of the .CSV file and update the event name list accordingly.
    </p>
    <h5>Special case: multiple columns</h5>
    <p>
        In cases where the .CSV file contains multiple columns, the utility app's graphical user interface (GUI) offers
        an additional panel to facilitate column selection. This feature allows users to choose the specific column(s)
        they want to include in the event name list.
    </p>
    <p>
        By selecting two or more columns, the app concatenates the row values from each selected column to create unique
        event names. This functionality is particularly useful for users who have different combinations of parameters
        that form a unique condition. Additionally, if the .CSV file contains headers, those headers are automatically
        included in the generated event names. This ensures that the resulting event names accurately represent the
        parameters associated with each condition. Here is an example of a .CSV file containing three columns:
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the data in the .CSV file:
    </p>
    <table style="table-layout: fixed;">
        <tr>
            <th style="width:20px" align="center">Test</th>
            <th style="width:20px" align="center">A</th>
            <th style="width:20px" align="center">B</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        And here is how it looks like when the data is loaded on the app:
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/events-manager_tool_multiCol_csv.png" alt="events-manager_tool_multiCol_csv" width="880">
    <p>
        To update the event names, just select the desired columns and click on the <b><i>Update list</i></b> button.
    </p>
    <h5>Vpixx output file</h5>
    <p>
        For users that utilize the Vpixx software (Vpixx Technologies) to create stimuli, the app provides the option to
        parse the <samp>.vpixx</samp> or <samp>.txt</samp> files generated by the Vpixx software and updates the event
        name list.
    </p>
    <p>
        The procedure for updating event names using <samp>.vpixx</samp> or <samp>.txt</samp>files generated by the
        Vpixx software is the same as for CSV files with a single column.
    </p>
    <h4 id="4_save-events">4. Save events</h4>
    <p>
        Finally, once all events are detected and the event names are updated from the condition file, simply click on
        the <b>Save events</b> button to save the event information to the <samp>events.mat</samp> file. This file
        contains all the information necessary for the analysis of event-triggered imaging data.
