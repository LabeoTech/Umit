    <h2>How <samp>.DAT</samp> Files Are Organized</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Imaging datasets are stored in binary files with the extension <samp>.dat</samp>. Each <samp>.dat</samp> file contains only a single channel. For example, in a recording where a fluorescence channel was acquired with red and green illuminations, each channel is stored separately in a dedicated <samp>.dat</samp> file. These files are created using one of the available <a href="/userDocs/fcns/dataImport_index.html"><i>Data Import</i></a> functions. 
        The binary files store only imaging data as 4-byte (32-bit) floating-point values (<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/single.html">single</a> precision). 
        To properly read a <samp>.dat</samp> file, the necessary information about data dimensions and precision is stored in an associated <samp>.mat</samp> file with the same name as the <samp>.dat</samp> file. This metadata file also stores other relevant details, such as the <samp>frame rate</samp> and <samp>exposure time</samp>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>The Metadata File</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
       As mentioned above, the <samp>.mat</samp> file associated with a binary <samp>.dat</samp> file contains all the metadata required to open and process the data in the toolbox. Below is an example of the metadata file contents:
    </p>
    
    <table style="table-layout: fixed;">
        <tr>
            <th style="width:130px" align="left">Field</th>
            <th align="left">Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">Datatype</td>
            <td>Format of numerical data (e.g., <samp>single</samp>)</td>
        </tr>           
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">Freq</td>
            <td>Recording sample rate in Hz</td>
        </tr>                                    
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">datSize</td>
            <td>Size of the first and second dimensions of data</td>            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">datLength</td>
            <td>Size of the third and additional dimensions of data</td>            
        </tr>            
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">dim_names</td>
            <td>Cell array with dimension identifiers, such as <b>T</b>ime, <b>X</b>, and <b>Y</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">dataHistory</td>
            <td>Structure array with metadata about the pipeline steps used to create the file. This is used by the <a href="../tools/pipeline_configuration_tool.html">Pipeline Manager Tool</a> to skip steps during a pipeline execution</td>
        </tr>                        
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">tExposure</td>
            <td>Illumination exposure time (in milliseconds)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h4>Minimal Required Information</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The minimal required metadata stored in the file should include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>dim_names:</strong> A cell array containing dimension identifiers such as X, Y, T(ime), and E(vent).</li>
        <li><strong>Datatype:</strong> The data's precision (e.g., <samp>single</samp>).</li>
        <li><strong>datSize</strong> and <strong>datLength</strong>: Data's dimensions. Used to properly read the values from the binary <samp>.dat</samp> file</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Metadata Changes During Data Processing</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        During a typical preprocessing pipeline, raw imaging data—typically stored as an image time series with dimensions Y, X, and T—can change. 
        When a new file is created, its metadata is inherited from the input file. If a parameter is modified during processing, the corresponding field is updated in the new metadata file.
        For example, if temporal binning is applied, the <samp>Freq</samp> parameter is adjusted accordingly while the rest of the metadata remains unchanged.
    </p>
    
    <div class="infonote">
        <p>
            <strong>A Note on Dimension Names</strong><br>
            The <samp><b>dim_names</b></samp> variable is used by some analysis functions as well as visualization tools to define how the data dimensions are structured.
            For instance, if an image time series is split by events and averaged, its dimensions will transition from a 3D format (Y, X, T) to a 4D structure (E, Y, X, T).
            A dictionary of valid dimension names can be found in the <samp>.mat</samp> file: <samp>/subFunc/dimension_names.mat</samp>.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Resources for Creating Custom Data Import Functions</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The toolbox provides helper functions for creating custom import functions that allow reading and saving <samp>.dat</samp> files. These functions are stored in the <samp>../subFunc/</samp> folder:
    </p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">loadDatFile</td>
            <td>Reads a <samp>.dat</samp> file</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">mapDatFile</td>
            <td>Maps the <samp>.dat</samp> file in RAM (see MATLAB's <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/memmapfile.html">memmapfile</a> documentation)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">save2Dat</td>
            <td>Saves data to a <samp>.dat</samp> file, including associated metadata</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="add_font_monospace">genMetaData</td>
            <td>Helps generate valid metadata for use with the <samp>save2Dat</samp> function. <b>Extra meta data can be included here.</b></td>
        </tr>
