    <h4 id="edit-object-s-properties">1. Edit object properties</h4>
    <p>
      Some of the properties of the project objects (i.e. Subjects, Acquisitions and Modalities) can be changed in the Dashboard tab. However, properties such as <b>ID</b>, are set during the object creation using the <a href="#">protocol function</a> and are read-only (see figure below).

    </p>
    <div class="tipnote">
      <p><strong>Tip</strong><br>
        It is always faster to set as many properties as possible during the object creation inside the <i>protocol function</i> and leave the rest to be set manually in the <b>Dashboard</b> tab!
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="delete-an-object">2. Delete an object</h4>
    <p>
      One can manually delete an object from the project. Only Subjects and Acquisitions can be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, the deleted objects are erased from the project file and send to the <i>Garbage List</i>. The objects listed in the <i>Garbarge List</i> are blacklisted from the project and will be ignored next time the project is updated.
    </p>
    <div class="infonote">
      <p><strong>Note</strong><br>
        No raw files are deleted during this process. It is only possible to delete transformed files inside the object&#39;s Save folder. If you wish to delete the raw data, you have to do it manually outside <b>umIT</b> and update the project.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      There are two options: to delete the object only OR to delete the object and all files inside the object's save folder:
