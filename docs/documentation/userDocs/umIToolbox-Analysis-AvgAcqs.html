    <h2>Average Acquisition - tool</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This tool averages the data across a number of <b>consecutive</b> acquisitions. For instance, in a longitudinal experiment design, one can perform a series of <b>control</b> recordings at the beginning of the experiment. This tool allows one to average these recordings and represent the data as a single control <i>acquisition</i>.

            This option is available <b>only</b> for experimental groups with the same number of acquisitions. For details on how to create experimental groups, click <a href="./data-grouping_tool.html">here</a>.

        Here, we illustrate how to average acquisitions with an example of a subject with four acquisitions where the two first acquisitions are a <i>control</i>. To have access to the <i>Avg. Acquisition</i> tool, first select the data and click on the <b>Select</b> button from the <a href="./umIToolbox-Analysis.html"> Analysis</a> tab of the <b><i>umIToolbox</i></b> app. The data looks as so:
