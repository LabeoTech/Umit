    <h2>Average Acquisition - tool</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This tool averages the data across a number of consecutive acquisitions. For instance, in a longitudinal experiment design, one can perform a series of <b>control</b> recordings at the beginning of the experiment. This tool allows one to average these recordings and represent the data as a single control <i>acquisition</i>.
