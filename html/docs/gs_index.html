    <h5><font color = "gray">Toolbox to manage, process and visualize widefield imaging experiments.</font></h5>
    <p>The <b><i>umIToolbox</i></b> is dedicated to the preprocessing, visualization and analysis of mesoscale imaging datasets. <b><i>umIT</i></b> provides tools to assist on experiment and data management, automation of data processing pipelines as well as imaging data visualization.</p>
    <p>Although the toolbox was conceived to work with large scale datasets, you can also use our <b><i>DataViewer</i></b> and <b><i>ROImanager</i></b> apps as <b>standalone</b> to quickly pre-process, visualize and extract data from single imaging recordings.</p>
