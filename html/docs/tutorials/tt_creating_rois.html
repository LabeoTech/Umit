    <h2>Create Regions of interest</h2>

    <p>
      In this tutorial, you will learn how to create regions of interest (ROIs) from imaging data. ROIs are frequently used in imaging projects to delimit areas of interest such as anatomical landmarks or brain functional modules identified by neuronal activation such as in the example used in our tutorial on <a href="./tt_creating_event_triggered_avg_maps.html"> creating event-triggered maps</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b><i>umIToolbox</i></b> has a dedicated app that creates, edits and
      manages ROIs called <i>ROImanager</i>. The app was briefly introduced in the tutorial on <a href="./tt_align_sessions.html">recording alignment</a> where it was used to create an <i>Imaging Reference Frame</i> file. There, we showed how to create a new <i>reference point</i>, how to set the image's <i>pixel size</i> and how to create a <i>logical mask</i>. These steps won't be covered here. For further details on the <i>ROImanager</i>, please refer to the app's <a href="#">documentation</a>. In this tutorial, we will focus on the different ways to create ROIs and how to save them for later use on the toolbox.
