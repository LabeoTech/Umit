    <h2>Creating a new project file</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This is the first step in order to use all the resources from <b><i>umIT</i></b>. The project file is a <samp>.mat</samp> file that contains a <samp>Protocol</samp> object. This object contains a database with the list of subjects and aquisitions as well as the experiments' meta data.
    </p>
    <p>The <samp>Protocol</samp> object uses a function (named <i>protocol function</i>) that scans the content of the raw directory containing the imaging recordings to create and update the database. The function <samp>protocolFcn_template.m</samp> is an example of <i>protocol function</i> that can be used as a starting point to create your own.

      <p><strong>Note</strong><br>
        The project file can only handle experiment files that inside <b>one</b> folder. For instance, if you have data across multiple hard drives, you will need to create one project file per location.

    <h3>The example dataset</h3>
    <p>
      The data used in our tutorials consists of widefield imaging of calcium signals from the mouse cortex acquired with <a href="https://www.labeotech.com/">LabeoTech</a>'s modular optical imaging system. The project consists of longitudinal recordings of a cohort of mice expressing <i>GCaMP6</i> in cortical excitatory neurons<a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/neurophotonics/volume-6/issue-02/025014/Comparison-between-transgenic-and-AAV-PHPeB-mediated-expression-of-GCaMP6s/10.1117/1.NPh.6.2.025014.full?SSO=1"><sup>1</sup></a>  under distinct experimental protocols. Thus, the project file will contain a series of subjects (i.e. mice) with each mouse having a series of different acquisitions over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raw data of each recording consists of a series of binary files located in a folder. The folder name contains the identifiers of the mouse and the acquisition as follows:

    </p>
    <p>
      In our example, all recording folders are located under one <i>main folder</i>. In the section below, we will show you how to create a project file using the <samp>protocolFcn_template</samp> function that was designed to read the data organized as mentioned above.
