# umIT (universal mesoscale Imaging Toolbox)
In memory of Umit Keysan (1992-2019)

This toolbox is conceived to manage, analyse and visualize serialized imaging datasets.
**umIT** was designed to process imaging data files from LabeoTech's [Light Track OiS200 system](https://www.labeotech.com/product/modular-optical-imaging-system/). For data from other sources, there is an option to import data stored in multi-frame TIF files.
