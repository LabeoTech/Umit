## umIToolbox installation

The current version of the umIToolbox was written in Matlab and is compatible with versions ***R2019a*** and above.
The following Matlab toolboxes are necessary to run all modules of ***umIT*** :
* Imaging processing toolbox
* ...

To install ***umIT*** , first clone or download the source code from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/S-Belanger/Umit).   
Then, create an environment variable named **Umitoolbox** with the path for the toolbox folder. 
Here are some guides to create environment variables in [Linux](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-set-environment-variable) and [MacOS](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/set-environment-variable-mac).
However, if your are running Matlab in Windows, execute the function *Umitoolbox_setupEnv.m* to automatically set the environment variable to your Windows account.

Now the toolbox is ready to use!
